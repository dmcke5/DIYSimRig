# CNCDan - DIY Sim Rig

![Alt text](title.png "DIY Sim Rig")

This project is part of my DIY Sim racing series. This sim rig is designed to work with all of my DIY sim racing accessories along with a any seat with rail hole spacing of 357x300mm (Width x Length).

The seat I used is from a Next Level Racing GTRacer 2.0. If you find a seat that is compatible with this design without any modifications, let me know and I will include a list of compatible models!
