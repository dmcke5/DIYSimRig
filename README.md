# CNCDan - DIY Sim Rig

![Alt text](title.png "DIY Sim Rig")

This project is part of my DIY Sim racing series. This sim rig is designed to work with all of my DIY sim racing accessories along with a any seat with rail hole spacing of 357x300mm (Width x Length).

The seat I used is from a Next Level Racing GTRacer 2.0. If you find a seat that is compatible with this design without any modifications, let me know and I will include a list of compatible models!

Be cautious with the steering bar brackets. The cut file is the same for both sides but you will need to countersink the holes on opposite sides so you have a mirrored pair of plates. I have uploaded a .STEP file for both so you can see what I mean.

If you decide to make the flat brackets yourself by hand, you should be able to open the DXF files and print them at 1:1 scale onto paper to use as a template. You could also 3D print the .STEP files and use them as a template.

Here's the wiring diagram to connect the Pedals to the FFBeast Wheel:

The order of the GPIO connections doesn't matter, just map the pedals as the correct inputs in the game and you'll be set!

If you want to build the whole set, here are the links to the other projects featured in this video!
